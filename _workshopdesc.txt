[h1]Spicebound:Core 1.0.0[/h1]
is a resource pack for Starbound. It aims to give most of the game a clean and unified aesthetic by way of many visual overhauls in one consistent style, including sleeker UI, cleaner and clearer item icons, redesigned enemies, touched-up tiles, and much more.

[h2]Is this mod compatible with X?[/h2]
Spicebound is a relatively unintrusive client-side mod.
At most, a Mod X that overrites the same files or edits the same sections of files as Spicebound may take priority over this mod if Mod X loads after it; likewise, this mod will take priority over others, though that's usually beneficial due to the nature of a texture pack.

[h2]Can you add cross-mod support for X?[/h2]
There's already a fair bit of support for other mods, and more that I want to do (alongside further vanilla-related updates), although I don't know what exactly I'll be doing next or when I'll do it.
Also, I'm not familiar with every mod out there! If you're the owner of (or somehow affiliated with) a mod that you want me to add support for, consider reaching out to ask.

[h2]How often does this mod update?[/h2]
The goal is to update this mod every 1-3 months at the absolute least.
Despite the fact that I'm currently working on a much larger content mod, Spicebound is my current primary outlet for spriting practice. I do things at my leisure, but usually this ends up being quite often with a fair bit of content between updates. This also means that there's no telling what I'll do next - everything's done on a whim. I pick things to resprite almost at random or as I see things that I think need it.
